If you've been looking for your own slice of heaven that is already cleared and ready to go, look no further. This land has been zoned for 5 homes or you can just keep it all to yourself. Water and electric have been ran to the site so just pull your permits and enjoy your private 6 acres. The land is located conveniently just south of downtown Conway. So although you're out in a rural area with no close neighbors, you can still be downtown in minutes and you're not far out from the beach either. It is rare to find acreage in such a great location. You won't find cleared parcels this size with utilities ran to them already. Drive by anytime and check it out before it's gone!!!
