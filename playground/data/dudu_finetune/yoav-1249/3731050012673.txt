Racial equity is a top reason Milwaukee resident Marlon Rockett supports marijuana legalization. Milwaukee County's non-binding marijuana legalization referendum motivated Rockett to cast an early ballot in the 2018 midterms. In 2018, blacks were four times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession in Wisconsin as whites, statistics show.
